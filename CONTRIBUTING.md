# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to BrkRaw.

We welcome contributions across:

- New sequence support (custom rules/specs/converter entrypoints)

- Reconstruction pipelines (FID-based or other custom paths)

- Image denoising or ML-powered workflows

- CLI plugins and tooling built on top of the BrkRaw API

## Extension points

You can extend BrkRaw without modifying core code:

- Add rules/specs/transforms via the `addon` CLI.

- Provide `converter_entrypoint` overrides for specialized conversion logic.

- Ship CLI plugins through `brkraw.cli` entrypoints.

See `docs/Addons-and-Plugins.md` for a detailed overview and examples in
`assets/examples/`.

## When core development is needed

Most workflows can be covered by rules/specs/transforms/maps. Core changes are
needed when the logic depends on context outside a single scan/reco or when the
API itself needs a new capability. Common cases:

- Cross-scan or study-level decisions (run numbering, ordering, de-duplication).

- Dataset-wide aggregation (derive flags from multiple scans).

- New file formats or exporters (beyond the default NIfTI/sidecar flow).

- Loader changes for new Paravision directory structures or zip formats.

- New CLI commands or option families (e.g., pruner, session helpers).

- Output filename logic that requires new metadata keys or non-local state.

If your use case falls into one of these, open an issue describing:

- Example dataset layout.

- The decision logic you need.

- Whether the solution can be expressed as a spec/map/transform.

## Defaults we want help with

We are looking for suggestions on default rules/specs to ship out of the box.
If you work with specific Bruker sequences, please propose:

- `info_spec` improvements for `brkraw info` / `BrukerLoader.info`.

- `metadata_spec` mappings for sidecar metadata (BIDS or lab standards).

- Rules that select the right spec based on `method`, `acqp`, or `visu_pars`.

Even small improvements (for example, better labels or parameter keys) are
useful. Open a PR or start a discussion with your sequence details and the
parameter files you rely on.

## Packaging and distribution

We encourage authors to package addons and plugins as standalone repositories
so they can be installed independently. This makes it easier to distribute new
tools to other labs and users.

## Community

If you build something useful, please open a PR or start a discussion. We plan
to periodically highlight community plugins on the BrkRaw main site.
