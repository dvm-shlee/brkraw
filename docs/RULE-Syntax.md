# Rule Syntax guide (specs.rules module)

This document describes the rule syntax used to select specs and entry points
from `~/.brkraw/rules/*.yaml`. Rule files are loaded in filename order and
evaluated top to bottom. If multiple rules match the same category, the last
matching rule wins (override).

## Rule File Layout

A rule file may contain any of the following top-level keys. You can mix them
in a single file.

- `info_spec`: rules that choose which scan metadata spec to use when calling
  info-related commands or methods (for example, metadata parsing in the scan
  resolver).
- `metadata_spec`: rules that choose which metadata spec to use when generating
  sidecar metadata, especially when a separate rule set is needed for metadata
  creation.
- `converter_entrypoint`: rules that choose a converter entry point. These are
  used by the loader when converting to NIfTI so that a custom reconstruction
  can be selected for scans matching the rule conditions.

Example:

```yaml
info_spec:
  - name: "mrs-info"
    description: "MRS method uses custom info spec"
    when:
      method:
        sources:
          - file: acqp
            key: ACQ_XXX
    if:
      eq: ["$method", "MRS"]
    use: "specs/mrs.yaml"

converter_entrypoint:
  - name: "mrs-reco"
    description: "MRS reconstruction plugin"
    when:
      method:
        sources:
          - file: acqp
            key: ACQ_XXX
    if:
      any:
        - eq: ["$method", "MRS"]
        - in: ["$method", ["MRS2", "MRS3"]]
    use: "mrs-reco"
```

## Rule Fields

Each rule item supports:

- `name` (required): identifier for logging/debugging.
- `description` (optional): human-readable explanation.
- `when` (required): variable bindings using remapper-style sources. Each
  variable may include `transform` to normalize values before matching.
- `if` (optional): condition expression using the variables from `when`.
- `use` (required): target spec path or entry point name.

## Variable Binding (`when`)

`when` defines named variables using remapper-style sources. Each variable name
is available in the `if` expression using `$<name>`. If a variable binding uses
`transform`, the transform name is resolved from the spec referenced by `use`
via `__meta__.transforms_source`.

See `docs/SPEC-Syntax.md` for details on remapper sources and transforms.

Example:

```yaml
when:
  method:
    sources:
      - file: acqp
        key: ACQ_XXX
    transform: normalize_method
```

This binds `$method` to the first available value from the sources list.

## Conditions (`if`)

The `if` field uses a simple structured expression. Supported operators:

- `eq`: `["$var", "value"]`
- `ne`: `["$var", "value"]`
- `in`: `["$var", ["A", "B"]]`
- `regex`: `["$var", "^prefix"]`
- `startswith`: `["$var", "prefix"]`
- `contains`: `["$var", "substring"]`
- `gt`, `ge`, `lt`, `le`: numeric comparisons
- `any`: list of expressions (OR)
- `all`: list of expressions (AND)
- `not`: single expression (NOT)

Example:

```yaml
if:
  any:
    - eq: ["$method", "XXXX"]
    - in: ["$method", ["A", "B", "C"]]
```

## Targets (`use`)

- `info_spec`/`metadata_spec` use a relative path to a YAML spec file under
  `~/.brkraw/specs/` (or another configured root).
- Transforms for `info_spec`/`metadata_spec` are defined in the spec file under
  `__meta__.transforms_source`.
- `converter_entrypoint` uses the entry point name registered under
  `brkraw.converter` (or another configured group).

## Override Behavior

All rule files under `~/.brkraw/rules/*.yaml` are loaded in filename order.
If multiple rules match the same category, the last matching rule wins.
